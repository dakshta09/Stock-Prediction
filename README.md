The purpose of this tool is to provide financial analytics of companies based on financial parameters like EBITDA, Total Revenue, debt-on-equity ratio, Diluted EPS, etc. Using these fields for the past 3 years we are trying to analyze if the company is in a good position to invest right now and how much return a person can anticipate for that company. It also provides stock predictions for the next 20 days for the investors who are interested in short term investments. 

## Problem Statement

- Lack of a holistic tool that provides short term and Long term investment analysis and takes latest news into account.
- Lack of financial knowledge in people who want to invest their money in high-return stocks results in inefficient decision-making as they donâ€™t realize the risks and uncertainty associated with it.
- Difficulty in integrating the financial information available, with the financial news due to lack of accessible tools and guidance
- Complexity and inaccessibility of financial data can refrain people from entering the stock market and making informed decisions
